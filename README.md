# Data
In this project, the task is to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

The dataset consists of 10 objects: airplanes, dogs, cats, and others. 

The dataset will be preprocessed (normalize to between 0 and 1, one-hot encoded).
Then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples using convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer.
